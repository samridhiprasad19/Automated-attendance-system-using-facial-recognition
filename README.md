# Automated-attendance-system-using-facial-recognition
This is my final year btech project. The main motivation to go for this project was the slow and inefficient traditional manual
attendance system. 
The objective of this system is to present an automated system for human face recognition for an
organization or institute to mark the attendance of their students or employees.
1. This product compares selected facial features from the image and a facial database. It is
typically used in security systems and can be compared to other bio metrics such as fingerprint or eye iris recognition systems.
2. If match is found then it will mark the attendance.
3. If match is not found then admin will place a query whether to add student data and accordingly
it will add or reject the student.
