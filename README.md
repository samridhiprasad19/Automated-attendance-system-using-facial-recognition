# Automated-attendance-system-using-facial-recognition
This is my final year btech project. The main idea behind this project is to automate the attendance system. This project uses facial recognition to mark the attendance
We observe that a lot of time is being wasted in taking attendance using traditional methods and is prone to errors.
In this project we capture the face of studend using webcam which is streaming video and capture the image and save the image in the local folder in the desktop as shown in the file face-detect.
After that we match the face from the database and attendance is marked.
